## SPS
> A full stack real estate web application , whith NestJS, RecatJS and MongoDB

## Features

1. FE with react in Typescript, using Tailwind, and with protected routes

2. BE with nestJS, authentication using JWT, REST API routes protected
   
3. Mongo db 


## Left over

1. I used RESTApi instead of graphQL
2. Infinite scroll for FE was not implemented
3. 

## Reasons Behind Technical Choices
1. I invest a lot of time searching some houses pictures and host them online somewhere, so I did not implemented infinite scroll in the front end, because I did not have enought house to make a large scrolling

2. Password is not encrypted, I passed it as clear text in the API, thing that I won't do in Prod level, this is a shortcut for the demo
3.
